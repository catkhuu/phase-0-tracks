    <p>Hey Anon, Admin Jessica here. Otis is A-OK, the blog is just on a bit of a hiatus as Ben has been pretty sick for the last few weeks (you can read more here). As soon as he’s feeling better, we’ll have more pictures to share of everyone’s favorite corgi :) Thanks for your concern!</p>

  <!--- **** START OF GPS 1.2 REFLECTION

  1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? Semantic tags are used to reinforce the meanings of a webpage. For example, should "Popular Corgis on the Internet" be expressed the same way as if it were put in a <p> or, since it's of importance on a certain subject, it should be given more emphasis and attention, which is why we put it in a <h3>? In building a webpage, I am a huge fan of the <header> and <footer> tags, and nested in it - the <nav> that to either internal or external links. If you use the <nav>, it allows you to link to your other pages internally. If not, then it will still bring you to another page of related content (externally, e.g. website on Corgi Rescues).
  2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? The main content that is displayed in the browser is in the <body>. However, other elements that can be nested within the <body> to define certain sections of a page are <section> <article> <aside> and <nav>.
  3. What about Sublime did you learn in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I never knew that you could create snippets in Sublime. I created a snippet that would FINALLY add the <!DOCTYPE html> to my html boilerplate - something that has really been bothering me ever since starting html. Now that I know how to create a snippet and find how useful they can be, I might be inclined to create more. I want to emphase, while snippets might serve there purpose as a timesaver, I think they can also waste your time if your snippet is too detailed and it includes elements that you might not want or need. Something to remember for myself, at least, when creating snippet. I find I always want to make it more intricate, but perhaps simplicity is best at times.
  4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? For me, it was difficult to understand when to use which element, such as <aside> or <article>. I never used them up until this GPS 1.2 challenge. They seem to work better in a blog setting as opposed to a regular webpage on corgis with no defined audience (aside prospective corgi owners/enthusiasts). Overall, when and why to use certain html5 semantic elements that were introduced to me today in this challenge.
