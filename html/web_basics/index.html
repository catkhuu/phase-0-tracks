  <p>Don't let that picture above fool you. There are more to these furry, four-legged friends than just endless appreciation for belly rubs! The corgi is a herding dog and will make a wonderful addition to any household even if you don't live in the midwest on a farm with a flock of geese or a herd of cattle. They will fit in wherever. But let's explore why else you or someone like <strong>me</strong> might want a corgi.</p>

  <h3>Why corgis are awesome:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They like and accept belly rubs.</li>
  <li>I swear, whenever a corgi smiles or even frowns, it looks <em>exactly</em> like me. How <strong>awesome</strong> is that?</li>
</ul>

<h4>See the resemblance? (I'm on the left)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>They are food motivated.</li>
  <li>There is an entire event dedicated to corgis depending on your coast/location. That event, my friends, is CORGI CON. That's right. Corgis and other corgi owners coming together to celebrate their favorite, furry, four-legged breed. From Pembroke, Welsh, and Cardigan Welsh corgis - you can see them <strong>ALL</strong>!!!</li>
</ul>

<h4>A kingdom of corgis.</h4>

<p>Despite all the great reasons that make corgis quite possibly the best four-legged companion, there are a few things to consider before you bring a corgi into your life. Though, I know we <em>all</em> want one up to this point.</p>

<h3>Minute reasons to consider before bringing home your lovable friend:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Corgis are <strong>MAJOR</strong> shedders. You could probably make a small rug out of all the dog hair that would accumulate in a week. Grooming your corgi will help with the shedding, but still, something to consider if tending to your corgis coat several times throughout the week screams "huge inconvenience" to you.</li>
  <li>Corgis are food motivated. A plus in my book, but maybe not in yours. Due to their short stature and appetitie for food, any food, really--this can lead to weight gain. This might not be a big problem for other dogs, but a corgi is not your typical dog. A few added pounds would really make a difference for these little guys. So either cut back on the treats (I know, this would be a tough one for me) <strong>OR</strong> you gotta hit the pavement with your four-legged friend. I, personally, am leaning towards the latter because you know what they say? Friends who train together, stay together. Life is a neverending marathon so why not improve both of our lives?</li>
  <li>This one goes for <strong>ANY</strong> dog. What does your work/life balance look like? Are you going to be home often enough to give your friend the care and attention they need? Because four-legged friends, or any friends, really--don't like being neglected. So, think carefully before taking on a huge responsibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm sure this page has given you plenty to think and dream about. If not, then here is my last <a href="http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120217/640/what_corgis_like_the_most_640_29.jpg">plea</a>.... corgi. out. *drops mic*</p>
